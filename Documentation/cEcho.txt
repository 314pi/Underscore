[cEcho] v.[2015-10-08] rev.[11:20:00] 

NAME 
      cEcho -- Template for DOS batch script 
  
SYNOPSIS 
      cEcho [Color] 'String' 
  
OPTIONS 
  -h      Help page 
  
 Color attributes are specified by TWO hex digits -- the first 
 corresponds to the background; the second the foreground.  Each digit 
 can be any of the following values: 
  
     0 = Black       8 = Gray 
     1 = Blue        9 = Light Blue 
     2 = Green       A = Light Green 
     3 = Aqua        B = Light Aqua 
     4 = Red         C = Light Red 
     5 = Purple      D = Light Purple 
     6 = Yellow      E = Light Yellow 
     7 = White       F = Bright White 
  
  If the string ends with a punctuation no newline will be added. 
  
  
DESCRIPTION 
  ECHO with color strings. Since WinDOS does not support writing using colors  
  on the command line this does the trick. 
  
EXAMPLES 
     CALL cEcho 0C 'Light red on black without new line.' 
     CALL cEcho 0E 'Light yellow on black' 
     CALL cEcho 0F 'Bright White on black' 
  
BUGS / KNOWN PROBLEMS 
  For some odd reason, there may be a delay of several seconds,  
  if you paste a call to cEcho into an open CMD session. 
 
REQUIRES 
  DEBUG.exe
