SYNOPSIS
  What.1 file-name [pattern] {flags}
  What.1 file-name [pattern]

OPTIONS
  -html       Output in HTML format
  -history    Display file history

DESCRIPTION
  Reads each file name and searches for sequences of the form
  "@(#)", as inserted by the source code control system (SCCS)
  It prints the remainder of the string following this marker,
  up to a null character, newline, double quote, or ">" character.

  So masking the VERY special characters is needed:
  {CURREN}	{LCURL}CURREN{RCURL}	Currency
  &	{LCURL}AMP{RCURL}		Ampersand
  ^	{LCURL}CARET{RCURL}		Caret
  !	{LCURL}EXCL{RCURL}		Exclamation mark
  >	{LCURL}GT{RCURL}		Greater than
  >	{LCURL}LT{RCURL}		Less than
  |	{LCURL}PIPE{RCURL}		Pipe or vertical bar
  (c)	{LCURL}COPY{RCURL}		Copyright
  {LPAR}	{LCURL}LPAR{RCURL}		Left parentheses
  {RPAR}	{LCURL}RPAR{RCURL}		Right parentheses
  {LCURL}	{LCURL}LCURL{RCURL}		Left curly parentheses
  {RCURL}	{LCURL}RCURL{RCURL}		Right curly parentheses
  %	{LCURL}PCT{RCURL}		Percent
  {QUEST}	{LCURL}QUEST{RCURL}		Question mark

  A pattern may be given to replace the x in (x) like:

     What.1 file pattern

  Will print all lines with the sequence: "@(pattern)"
  Note: Patterns are case insensitive
