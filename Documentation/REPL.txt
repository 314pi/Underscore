NAME 
      REPL -- Search and replace 
 
SYNOPSIS 
      REPL [VAR] 
 
OPTIONS 
  -h      Help page 
 REPL  Search  Replace  [Options  [SourceVar]] 
 REPL  /\x3F[REGEX{PIPE}REPLACE] 
 REPL  /V 
 
  If called with a single argument of /V, case insensitive, then prints 
  the version of REPL.BAT. 
 
  Search  - By default, this is a case sensitive JScript (ECMA) regular 
            expression expressed as a string. 
 
            JScript regex syntax documentation is available at 
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ae5bf541(v=vs.80).aspx 
 
  Replace - By default, this is the string to be used as a replacement for 
            each found search expression. Full support is provided for 
            substituion patterns available to the JScript replace method. 
 
            For example, ${AMP} represents the portion of the source that matched 
            the entire search pattern, $1 represents the first captured 
            submatch, $2 the second captured submatch, etc. A $ literal 
            can be escaped as $$. 
 
            An empty replacement string must be represented as ''. 
 
            Replace substitution pattern syntax is fully documented at 
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/efy6s3e6(v=vs.80).aspx 
 
  Options - An optional string of characters used to alter the behavior 
            of REPL. The option characters are case insensitive, and may 
            appear in any order. 
 
            I - Makes the search case-insensitive. 
 
            L - The Search is treated as a string literal instead of a 
                regular expression. Also, all $ found in Replace are 
                treated as $ literals. 
 
            B - The Search must match the beginning of a line. 
                Mostly used with literal searches. 
 
            E - The Search must match the end of a line. 
                Mostly used with literal searches. 
 
            V - Search and Replace represent the name of environment 
                variables that contain the respective values. An undefined 
                variable is treated as an empty string. 
 
            A - Only print altered lines. Unaltered lines are discarded. 
                If both the M and V options are present, then prints the 
                entire result if there was a change anywhere in the string. 
                The A option is incompatible with the M option unless the S 
                option is also present. 
 
            M - Multi-line mode. The entire contents of stdin is read and 
                processed in one pass instead of line by line, thus enabling 
                search for \n. This also enables preservation of the original 
                line terminators. If the M option is not present, then every 
                printed line is termiated with carriage return and line feed. 
                The M option is incompatible with the A option unless the S 
                option is also present. 
 
            X - Enables extended substitution pattern syntax with support 
                for the following escape sequences within the Replace string: 
 
                \\     -  Backslash 
                \b     -  Backspace 
                \f     -  Formfeed 
                \n     -  Newline 
                \q     -  Quote 
                \r     -  Carriage Return 
                \t     -  Horizontal Tab 
                \v     -  Vertical Tab 
                \xnn   -  Extended ASCII byte code expressed as 2 hex digits 
                \unnnn -  Unicode character expressed as 4 hex digits 
 
                Also enables the \q escape sequence for the Search string. 
                The other escape sequences are already standard for a regular 
                expression Search string. 
 
                Also modifies the behavior of \xnn in the Search string to work 
                properly with extended ASCII byte codes. 
 
                Extended escape sequences are supported even when the L option 
                is used. Both Search and Replace support all of the extended 
                escape sequences if both the X and L opions are combined. 
 
            S - The source is read from an environment variable instead of 
                from stdin. The name of the source environment variable is 
                specified in the next argument after the option string. Without 
                the M option,  anchors the beginning of the string, and $ the 
                end of the string. With the M option,  anchors the beginning 
                of a line, and $ the end of a line. 
 
DESCRIPTION 
    Performs a global regular expression search and replace operation on 
    each line of input from stdin and prints the result to stdout. 
 
    Each parameter may be optionally enclosed by double quotes. The double 
    quotes are not considered part of the argument. The quotes are required 
    if the parameter contains a batch token delimiter like space, tab, comma, 
    semicolon. The quotes should also be used if the argument contains a 
    batch special character like ampersant, pipe, etc. so that the special character 
    does not need to be escaped with charet. 
 
    If called with a single argument of /\x3F, then prints help documentation 
    to stdout. If a single argument of /\x3FREGEX, then opens up Microsoft's 
    JScript regular expression documentation within your browser. If a single 
    argument of /\x3FREPLACE, then opens up Microsofts JScript REPLACE 
    documentation within your browser.
