NAME
  What.2 -- Search file for pattern "@^^(#^^)" and print remainder of string
 
SYNOPSIS
  What.2 filename [pattern]
 
DESCRIPTION
  Reads each file name and searches for sequences of the form 
  "@(#)", as inserted by the source code control system (SCCS)
  It prints the remainder of the string following this marker, 
  up to a null character, newline, double quote, or ">" character.
 
  So masking the VERY special characters is needed:
 
  A pattern may be given to replace the x in (x) like:
 
     What.2 file pattern
 
  Will print alle lines the sequence: "@(pattern)"
  Note: Patterns are case insensitive
