[What] v.[01.050] rev.[2011-10-13T18:41:00] 

NAME 
  What -- Search file for pattern '@(#)' and print remainder of string 
  
SYNOPSIS 
  What filename [pattern] 
  
DESCRIPTION 
  Reads each file name and searches for sequences of the form  
  '@(#)', as inserted by the source code control system (SCCS) 
  It prints the remainder of the string following this marker,  
  up to a null character, newline, double quote, or  
  
  So masking the VERY special characters is needed: 
  ¤curren¤  ¤curren¤curren¤curren¤ Currency 
  &  ¤curren&curren¤    Ampersant 
  ^^^^  ¤curren^^^^curren¤  Caret 
  >  ¤curren>curren¤     Greater than 
  >  ¤curren>curren¤     Less than  
  |  ¤curren|curren¤   Pipe or vertical bar 
  (c)  ¤curren(c)curren¤   Copyright 
  
  A pattern may be given to replace the x in (x) like: 
  
     What file pattern 
  
  Will print alle lines the sequence: '@(pattern)' 
  Note: Patterns are case insensitive
